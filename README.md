SimpleStepper
=============

Simple library for driving Stepper motors with arduino. It will support acceleration and maybe other stuff.
<h3>Limitations:</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>As it uses the arduino built-in function "delaMicroseconds" for it's labor, it only supports one motor moving at a time. </li>
    <li>Because of the same reason, when it's moving the motor, nothing else can happen in the arduino.</li>
  </ul>
